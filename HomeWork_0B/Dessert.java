public class Dessert {
    /*
    Compared to your previous classes, 61B may leave a lot of wiggle room for you on assignments.
    For example, there’s no skeleton code for this exercise - don’t be alarmed!
    Create a class called Dessert (you’ll need to create a new file and add it to Git) inside of the src/ folder.
    This class should have the following characteristics:

    Two instance variables: int flavor and int price.
    A constructor that takes two parameters int flavor and int price and sets the instance variables accordingly.
    One static variable int numDesserts that keeps track of the number of desserts created so far.

    A method public void printDessert() that prints the flavor and price of the dessert,
    along with the total number of desserts created so far, separated by a space.

    For example, if we create a dessert with flavor 1 and price 2, and then call its printDessert() method,
    it should print 1 2 1.
    If we then create a dessert with flavor 3 and price 4, and then call its printDessert() method,
    it should print 3 4 2.
    Lastly, a method public static void main(String[] args) that only prints the line I love dessert! when executed.
    Be sure to implement the above behavior exactly, otherwise you may not pass the tests!

    When you have completed Dessert.java, uncomment the appropriate lines in tests/DessertTest and run the test.
